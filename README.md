# Project for course AH2173: Itinerary planner based on the previous delays of the vehicles for SL

Report available for information

## Abstract

In this project, we focused on addressing the crucial concern of trip planning for
public transportation users. The selection of an optimal itinerary holds the potential to
save valuable time for these individuals. Typically, users rely on the solution provided
by the transport operator. However, our investigation aimed to determine the extent to
which we could surpass this solution by incorporating historical network delays into
the planner.
To conduct our study, we looked at 6 trips from Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL),
which provides real-time information that we collected over several days.We analyzed
this data to get the real departure times of the vehicles, and so the delay for every
journey. We focused, then, on the distribution of the delays, before the departure of a
vehicle and during the journey.
Automating route searches based on different criteria has enabled us to create and
compare different models. We tested the models for both real-time proposition and
10 minutes in advance proposition. In all cases, the result is that the best-performing
model is the one that includes in the construction of the itinerary the median delay.
